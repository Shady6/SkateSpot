### Disclaimer
Before trying out the website I have to inform that you'll get "For development purposes only" overlay while viewing map with spots. It is because of changes that google made to their billing model but the map is actually still working.  

You can try this web app by yourself here https://skatespot111.herokuapp.com/. To login you can use those example credentials I made - email : example@test.com   password : 123456.
# SkateSpot - what is it about?
SkateSpot is a web application created for skateboarders and all the people who do extreme sports on wheels. The purpose of the webpage is to create a database of skateboarding spots (places where you can ride skateboard: skateparks, stairs, rails etc.). Users can add their own spots with extensive description which includes photos, tags, address and other things. Everyone can also view added places on the map by clicking the pin. The Website is in Polish language because it was aimed at Polish audiance.
